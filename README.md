## About the Project

### Overview

In the dynamic landscape of organizational operations, managing the availability of meeting rooms poses a constant challenge. Offices often require these spaces for a variety of purposes, ranging from impromptu meetings to brief, private phone calls. However, the current methods of room availability checks are cumbersome and can lead to disruptions or unnecessary delays.

**MeetMinder** emerges as a solution to these challenges, offering real-time insights into meeting room statuses, thereby fostering seamless room management for organizations.

### The Problem

Traditional approaches to verify room availability are fraught with inefficiencies:

- Intrusive Checks: Risk of interrupting ongoing meetings by physically checking room occupancy.
- Immediate Evictions: Instances where one might occupy a room, only to be ousted due to a pre-scheduled meeting.
- Cumbersome Searches: Navigating through calendars or booking systems is time-consuming and inefficient.

These methods are intrusive, time-consuming, and often lead to professional embarrassment or workflow disruption.

### The Solution: MeetMinder

MeetMinder epitomizes convenience and efficiency in this domain. Positioned strategically next to the meeting room, a screen provides at-a-glance information on room status, ensuring employees make informed decisions without the need to disrupt ongoing sessions or engage in tedious checks.

#### Core Features

MeetMinder optimizes room management by displaying:

- **Current Room Status:** Easily ascertain whether a room is occupied or available.
- **Upcoming Meeting Alerts:** View the start time of the next meeting.
- **Ongoing Meeting Duration:** Understand how long the current meeting will last.
- **Event Queue:** Preview the next three events scheduled in the room.
- **Event Details:** Discern the context with the names of the meetings.

With these features, MeetMinder streamlines the process of meeting room allocation, reduces workplace disruptions, and contributes to organizational efficiency.

## Requirements

To ensure smooth deployment and operational success, MeetMinder necessitates specific hardware components and software subscriptions. Below is a checklist of the essential requirements:

### hardware

- **Display:** Any monitor or digital display screen compatible with standard connection interfaces (HDMI/USB-C/VGA).
- **Mini PC:** A compact computer, connected to the display, capable of continuous operation (Confirmed compatibility with Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Raspberry Pi 4 models).

### Software

- **Google Workspace Subscription:** Active subscription to access necessary API features and calendar resources.

### Connectivity

- **Stable Internet Connection:** Essential for real-time data retrieval and system operations. MeetMinder requires continuous internet access to function, as it relies on cloud-based services for updates on meeting schedules and room availability statuses.

It is imperative that users ensure these requirements are met for seamless installation, setup, and utilization of MeetMinderâ€™s features. The absence of a consistent internet connection, notably, will impede the system's ability to provide updated information, thereby negating its primary benefits.

Please note, while the system has been tested on specified hardware, it is adaptable with any setup meeting the criteria mentioned above. Users should ensure stable internet connectivity for optimal performance.
